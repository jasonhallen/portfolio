# Portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio!  Here you'll find examples of documentation and code I've written.

## Code

### Email Notices Project
Alma email notice templates are written in XSLT, and I've had to customize several of them.  XXXX is an example of one such notice.  I've annotated my customizations in the code.

### Music Generator
This coding project automatically composes and renders electronic music.  I coded it from scratch, and you can explore the code here.  The automatic composing of the music is managed by a collection of classes, methods, and transformation rules coded in Python.  Of particular interest is the way that functions are passed as agruments into other functions in the transformation rules.  code revolves around classes and rules which .  The Csound code .  You can read more about how the code works in this [blog post](LINK).

### Looper
The Looper is a web-based interactive sample manipulator that you can play with on my [website](LINK).  The core functionality, including all interactive elements and graphical displays, is built with a JavaScript animation library called [p5.js](LINK).  The audio processing and sound design are built in [Web Csound](LINK).  See the code base [here](LINK).

### Thrive to Death
[Thrive to Death](https://twitter.com/thrivetodeath) is a Twitter bot I designed as a parody of productivity gurus.  The code is written in [Tracery](https://tracery.io/), which is a language for specifying generative grammars.  Every day the code is used to generate a random motivational saying that gets published on Twitter. 

## Websites

### Gould Library
When I became responsible for managing the [Gould Library website](LINK) in 20XX, it had not had a thorough review and restructuring in many years.  As a result, we received regular feedback from users that the website was confusing to use.  During the summer and fall of 2019 I led a cross-departmental task force that did an environmental scan of peer libraries' websites, research the literature on library websites, conducted card sorts with users, and overhauled the information architecture of the website.  In the summer of 2020 I led a different cross-departmental group in the migration of the website from Reason into WordPress.  This migration included a content review, the merging of four separate websites into one, More work remains to be done, including adding an Instagram feed to the home page, incorporating a library hours integration with LibCal, and working with Web Services on a new solution for the Exhibitions events.

### Personal Website
www.jasonhallen.com is built in Joomla.  In order to achieve the clean, minimal, yet functional appearance I've had to do extensive CSS and moderate PHP customization.

## Documentation

### Technology Instructions
Part of my job is to ensure library staff can use the technology in the library.  I made this sign to help staff understand how to use the new technology in our conference room.

### Website Management
As I touched on in my description of the Gould Library website above, the website had not been actively stewarded for many years when I took it on.  When we migrated from Reason to WordPress in 2020
